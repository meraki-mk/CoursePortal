                    <p>Machine Learning is the field of study that gives computers the capability to learn without being explicitly programmed.<br>
                         ML is one of the most exciting technologies that one would have ever come across.</p>

                    <h5>ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE</h5>
                    <p>Intelligence, as we know, is the ability to acquire and apply the knowledge.<br>
                       Knowledge is the information acquired through experience.<br>
                       Experience is the knowledge gained through exposure(training).<br>
                       Summing the terms up, we get artificial intelligence as the “copy of something natural<br>
                       (i.e., human beings) ‘WHO’ is capable of acquiring and applying the information it has gained through exposure.”</p>

                    <h5>INTERNET OF THINGS</h5>
                    <p>Internet of Things (IoT) is the networking of physical objects that contain electronics embedded within their architecture<br>
                       in order to communicate and sense interactions amongst each other or with respect to the external environment.<br>
                       In the upcoming years, IoT-based technology will offer advanced levels of services<br>
                       and practically change the way people lead their daily lives.<br>
                       Advancements in medicine, power, gene therapies, agriculture, smart cities, and smart homes<br>
                       are just a very few of the categorical examples where IoT is strongly established.</p>
